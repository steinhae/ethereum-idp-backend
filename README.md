# Repairchain Backend
The idea for Repairchain was developed during a workshop organized by the [Blockchain Research Group at Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.blockchain.tum.de "Blockchain Research Group at TUM"). Contact person and project supervisors are [Dr. Andranik Tumasjan](mailto:andranik.tumasjan@tum.de) and [Marcus M체ller](mailto:marcus.mueller@tum.de). The project was realized in context of the interdisciplinary project in coorperation with the Department of Informatics And Mathematics by [Anton Widera, Hannes Steinh채user and Joseph Palckal.](#authors).

The scope of this project was to develop a proof of concept DApp consisting of a frontend in form of an Android app and a backend consisting of smart contracts deployed to the Ethereum Blockchain. This repositiory contains the Android app.

The idea behind Repairchain is that citizen can report
all kinds of issues in a city. Issues could be damaged road infrastructure, broken street lamps or any other kind of damages. Participating users can either confirm or reject these damage reports to have a crowdsourced administration of the issues. 
There is an existing app called SeeClickFix that offers similar functionalities with some
major disadvantages emerging from standard client/server architecture. Repairchain will
manage those by using blockchain technology and smart contracts. The following points are
addressed: 
* No need for a third party / intermediate &#8594; eliminates single point of failure and
reduces the cost
* Integrity by non-editable log &#8594; issues cannot be ignored/deleted by the city and must be handled
* Easy payment / rewards &#8594; sending funds in cryptocurrency is a built-in feature of
most Blockchains
* User are privileged &#8594; less administrative effort
* High automation possible &#8594; less personal needed, faster execution of operations

## Deplyoing the Contract

The solidity code that can be deployed on the Ethereum Blockchain is in the Report.sol file in the src folder. There exist multipe ways to deploy the code. One of the easiest ways is to use the [Ethereum Wallet](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases) developed by the Ethereum project.
